# Network-Project

Basic network site developed with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Django Framework

This project is a network site where users have the ability to register, login, view all current posts made by themselves or other users, create and edit a post, like and unlike a post, view individual profiles, follow and unfollow users, and access a "following" page that only displays posts made by the users they follow.

Personal Favorite Code Block - This block tested my understanding of javascript and required learning to route fetch requests through a specific Django view to make changes within the database to add and remove likes using POST/DELETE requests and edit current posts using a PUT request.

Extra: This was my first time routing through a view that would not actually be "viewed". The purpose of this view is collecting JSON data, converting it into a format the database could read, and then changing the database accordingly.
