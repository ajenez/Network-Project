# Network-Project

Basic network site developed with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Django Framework

This project is a network site where users have the ability to register, login, view all current posts made by themselves or other users, create and edit a post, like and unlike a post, view individual profiles, follow and unfollow users, and access a "following" page that only displays posts made by the users they follow.

Personal Favorite Code Block - This block tested my understanding of javascript and required learning to route fetch requests through a specific Django view to make changes within the database to add and remove likes using POST/DELETE requests and edit current posts using a PUT request.

Extra: This was my first time using Django's Modelforms and it was really interesting discovering how they work and the power that Django has right out of the box!
